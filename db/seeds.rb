The creators of The Harry Potter Lexicon created a guide of some 2,400 entries explaining various aspects of the fiction world of Harry Potter.  The idea for the book came following the success of a popular Harry Potter fan site, which was a preliminary, online version of the Lexicon RDR Books sought to publish.  The website received favorable feedback from Rowling herself.The website's creator had, himself, expressed uncertainty as to the legality of ever publishing his online encyclopedia in print form.  However, he was persuaded by RDR Books to go through with publication.  The plan was to have the book out by late October 2007, to capitalize on the fervor over the final book of the series.  When Warner Bros. learned of RDR's intent, it sent several letters requesting that the company delay publishing until the two could work out any legal issues in good faith.  However, RDR both refused to delay publication and to provide Warner Bros. with a Lexicon manuscript.  On October 31, 2007, Warner Bros. brought suit and requested a preliminary injunction to halt publication.",

The court notes that while in some Lexicon definitions, using short pieces of writings from the book takes a reasonable amount of material, in others it appropriates an unnecessary amount of expressive language from the text.  This factor may be said to weigh against a finding of fair use, and receives a red light.",

These books also provide insights into and extra rare parts of the Harry Potter world.  Publication may also harm the future licensing of items such as the songs and poems that appear in the novels, because the Lexicon reproduces these exactly without having license.

Applying the four part test described in Section 107 of the Copyright Act, the court found Koons' use of the photograph to be sufficiently transformative.

Koons' incorporation of the photograph was considered justified by a 'creative rationale,' rather than done simply 'to get attention' or to recycle someone else's ideas.
